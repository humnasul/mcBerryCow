# mcBerryCow
Source files for creating a modeled strawberry cow in Minecraft!! CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS!  
Summer 2023 around June - I decided I wanted to make a Strawberry/Pink Cow in Minecraft :)  
Using MCreator, Blockbench, IntelliJ IDEA!!  
### Files:  
test_cow.java is the basic model of a cow that I am utilizing in Blockbench, imported through the CEM Template Loader Plug-In and converted for Minecraft Java Edition - had to be debugged due to syntax errors when exporting but does work as a model in MCreator as of now!
